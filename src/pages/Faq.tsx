                            <p className="mt-2">Acrylates are a family of chemicals commonly used in cosmetics, skincare, and nail products to provide adhesion, form a film, or thicken a formula. While generally safe, they are a known cause of allergic contact dermatitis for a growing number of people. An allergy can develop over time with repeated exposure.</p>

                            <p className="mt-2">"Fungal acne," officially known as Malassezia folliculitis, is an infection of the hair follicle caused by an overgrowth of Malassezia yeast, which is naturally present on the skin. This condition results in small, itchy, acne-like bumps. Certain cosmetic ingredients, particularly specific fatty acids and esters, can "feed" this yeast and worsen the condition.</p>

                            <p className="mt-2">Our tool uses a comprehensive internal database of known acrylates and fungal acne triggers. When you paste an ingredient list, the tool performs a rapid search against this database to identify any matches. It's a fast, offline process that respects your privacy, as your ingredient list is never sent to a server.</p>

                            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800">How accurate is the tool? üéØ</h2>
                            <p className="mt-2">The analyzer relies on a curated list of known trigger ingredients. While we strive to keep our database comprehensive and up-to-date, it may not be exhaustive. New chemical names or derivatives may not be included. Therefore, the results should be used as a guideline, not a definitive verdict. Always double-check with other sources and consult a professional if you have serious concerns.</p>
